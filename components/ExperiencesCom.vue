        <p class="break-words">  <b>At Chamroeun MFI</b>, I've been immersed in coding projects that directly impact the organization's operations. Besides honing my skills in Vue.js, Laravel, and MySQL, I've been intricately involved in projects related to loan management, where I've combined my coding expertise with an understanding of financial processes to streamline loan applications and enhance repayment tracking.

            The opportunity to work at the intersection of technology and microfinance has been incredibly rewarding. Witnessing how coding solutions can revolutionize traditional financial practices has been a driving force in my journey. Additionally, my internship at Atech exposed me to the practical aspects of technology, where I got hands-on experience with hosting, domain management through GoDaddy, and further refining my skills in Vue.js and Laravel.
            
            Overall, my focus has been on leveraging technology to create impactful solutions. Whether it's optimizing loan processes or developing robust web applications, I'm enthusiastic about utilizing my skills to contribute meaningfully to organizations and make a difference in the world of finance through technology.</p>

        <p class="break-words"><b>At Atech</b>, one of the significant projects I worked on was developing a platform similar to LinkedIn but focused on job seekers. This project involved leveraging Vue.js for the frontend and Laravel for the backend to create a robust and user-friendly platform.

            With Vue.js, I crafted dynamic and interactive user interfaces, ensuring a seamless experience for job seekers navigating the platform. The frontend capabilities of Vue.js allowed me to implement features that made job searching, profile creation, and networking intuitive and engaging.
            
            On the backend, utilizing Laravel was instrumental in building a scalable and efficient system. I integrated functionalities for job postings, user profiles, messaging, and networking, ensuring smooth communication and interaction between job seekers and potential employers.
            
            This project provided a hands-on experience in developing a comprehensive platform tailored to the needs of job seekers, incorporating features akin to LinkedIn but with a specialized focus on job hunting and professional networking.
            
            Throughout this endeavor, I honed my skills in Vue.js and Laravel, understanding their practical application in creating a sophisticated web platform. It was a rewarding project that deepened my knowledge of frontend and backend development while allowing me to contribute to the creation of a valuable resource for job seekers.</p>
